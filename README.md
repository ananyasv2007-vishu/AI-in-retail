Application of  Artificial Intelligence in the Retail  
chapter 01 Abstract 
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a pivotal force in the retail industry, 
driven by acute margin pressures and a fundamental shift in customer 
expectations. A review of the academic literature highlights key areas of focus, 
including the use of advanced machine learning frameworks for price and 
markdown optimization, the enhancement of demand forecasting models 
through the integration of macroeconomic variables, and the critical need for 
ethical frameworks to govern data privacy and algorithmic fairness. In practice, 
AI is being deployed across the retail value chain with demonstrable success. 
Current applications are optimizing core operations through more accurate 
demand forecasting, which has been shown to significantly reduce food waste, 
and automating in-store processes. Concurrently, AI is revolutionizing the 
customer experience by delivering hyper-personalized recommendations and 
enabling a new paradigm of "searchless retail." Despite these advancements, 
significant challenges persist, including organizational inertia, inadequate data 
governance, and the imperative to build consumer trust. The primary findings of 
this report conclude that AI is no longer an optional investment but a 
foundational requirement for competitive viability. The future of retail will be 
defined by the ability of organizations to embed AI into a clear operating model, 
cultivate a culture of trust and transparency, and strategically reskill their 
workforce, thereby transforming technological potential into a sustainable 
competitive advantage. 
Chapter 2.0 Introduction 
The modern retail sector is navigating an existential crisis. To comprehend the 
path forward, industry leaders must first grasp the severity of the forces 
reshaping the landscape. The convergence of collapsing margins, inflation
masked stagnation, and escalating consumer demands has rendered traditional 
operating models obsolete. This chapter will detail these profound pressures and 
introduce the report's central thesis: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer an 
enhancement but the new foundational operating system for survival and growth 
in the retail industry. 
Retailers today are confronting a dual pressure that leaves no room for strategic 
error. The first is an acute margin erosion, detailed by McKinsey, which can 
strip 100 to 150 basis points from grocery retailers and as much as 350 to 500 
basis points from apparel or department stores due to the high costs of e
commerce, labor, and intense competition. This is not a standalone issue. It is 
dangerously compounded by the market dynamic identified by Capgemini, 
where top-line revenue growth is largely an inflationary illusion masking 
stagnant unit sales. While U.S. retail sales have reached a 20-year high, the 
actual volume of goods sold has remained flat. This dual pressure creates a 
perilous environment where retailers are working harder for functionally the 
same or less volume, making AI-driven efficiency a non-negotiable strategic 
imperative. 
In response to these formidable challenges, the retail industry has turned to 
Artificial Intelligence as its transformative solution. AI is no longer a futuristic 
concept but a practical and increasingly indispensable tool being deployed to 
redefine every facet of the business. The scale of this technological shift is 
significant. The global AI retail market is projected to exceed $40 billion by 
2030, according to Berkeley Research Group (BRG). This rapid investment 
reflects a broad consensus on AI's potential; as early as 2021, 75% of retailers 
had already adopted some form of AI technology (Shekhawat, 2022, as cited in 
EA Journals, 2024). This adoption is not merely a defensive measure against 
margin erosion; it is a strategic offensive to meet surging customer expectations 
for the seamless, personalized, and frictionless shopping experiences that only 
AI can deliver at scale. 
This report aims to provide a formal analysis of the state of AI in the retail 
sector. Its purpose is to synthesize current knowledge, assess real-world impact, 
and provide a strategic outlook for industry stakeholders. The scope of this 
investigation is comprehensive, covering the key drivers of AI adoption, the 
theoretical foundations established in academic literature, and the practical 
applications currently delivering value across retail operations. It will examine 
how AI is being used to optimize supply chains, enhance customer engagement, 
and refine marketing and merchandising strategies, all in service of its new role 
as the core operating system of modern retail. 
The subsequent chapters are structured to guide the reader from a theoretical 
understanding to a practical application of AI in retail. Chapter 3.0 offers a 
detailed literature review, synthesizing findings from seminal research papers on 
topics such as demand forecasting, price optimization, and ethics. Chapter 4.0 
transitions to an analysis of current, real-world applications that are working 
today, providing concrete examples of AI's impact. Finally, Chapter 5.0 
concludes the report with a summary of key findings, an exploration of future 
trends, and an outline of the strategic imperatives that will define the next wave 
of retail intelligence. 
Chapter 3.0 Literature Review 
A thorough review of the existing academic and professional literature is 
essential for establishing the theoretical and practical context of Artificial 
Intelligence in retail. By examining seminal and recent research, we can identify 
the dominant themes, prevailing methodologies, and critical questions that 
shape the field. This chapter synthesizes key research papers to provide a 
comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding AI's application, from 
sophisticated price optimization frameworks to the crucial, emerging discourse 
on ethics and governance. 
Paper 1: An End-to-End Machine Learning Framework for Optimizing 
Markdown in Online Fashion E-commerce 
• Author(s): Loh, E., Khandelwal, J., Regan, B., & Little, D. A. 
• Year: 2022 
• Summary: This paper presents two novel, end-to-end systems designed at 
ASOS.com to manage and optimize markdown promotional events, a critical 
function in the fast-paced online fashion industry. The first system, "Ithax," is a 
supply-side algorithm that selects products for markdown and sets initial prices 
based on inventory management principles, such as a product's "cover" (weeks 
to sell-out). The second, "Promotheus," integrates Ithax's product selection with 
a price elasticity model to adjust prices based on predicted demand, with the 
goal of maximizing profitability. A core argument of the paper is the necessity 
of rigorous, real-world online tests for evaluating price optimization systems, as 
offline numerical analysis is insufficient. In controlled online tests, both systems 
demonstrated significant improvements over manual strategies, with 
Promotheus increasing profitability by 86% and Ithax by 79%. This research 
provides the theoretical and empirical validation for the AI-driven markdown 
optimization strategies now being deployed by leading retailers, a topic 
explored in Section 4.1. 
Paper 2: Retail Demand Forecasting: A Comparative Study for Multivariate 
Time Series 
• Author(s): Haque, M. S., Amin, M. S., & Miah, J. 
• Year: 2023 
• Summary: This study addresses a critical gap in retail demand forecasting 
literature, which has traditionally focused on historical sales data while largely 
ignoring the influence of macroeconomic conditions. The paper's central thesis 
is that forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved by enriching time 
series data with key macroeconomic variables, specifically the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI), the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and unemployment rates. 
The authors document the evolution of forecasting techniques from traditional 
statistical methods like SARIMA to more powerful machine learning models 
such as Random Forests and XGBM. The study cites Haque (2023), which 
demonstrated the superior performance of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
model when its training dataset was enriched with these external economic 
factors. This finding underpins the advanced demand forecasting applications 
discussed in Section 4.1, which leverage external data to enhance operational 
efficiency. 
Paper 3: Ethical AI in Retail: Consumer Privacy and Fairness 
• Author(s): [Not specified in source] 
• Year: 2024 
• Summary: This paper examines the critical ethical dimensions of AI 
implementation in the retail sector, with a specific focus on consumer privacy, 
data protection, and algorithmic fairness. It argues that as AI becomes more 
integrated into retail—predicting that 85% of customer interactions will be 
managed without human agents by 2025 (citing Guha et al., 2021)—the 
responsible management of consumer data becomes paramount. The research 
emphasizes the necessity for retailers to secure informed consent for data 
collection and to establish robust security measures to prevent misuse. 
Furthermore, the paper highlights the risk of algorithmic bias, where AI systems 
might unfairly discriminate against certain consumer groups. It concludes that 
ensuring fairness and transparency is not only an ethical obligation but also a 
business imperative for maintaining customer trust. These ethical considerations 
represent one of the most significant challenges to meaningful AI adoption, as 
detailed in Section 5.1.

in Grocery Retail 2022 
This case study details how retailers used AI solutions to improve order 
accuracy for fresh goods. The pilots resulted in a 14.8% average reduction in 
food waste per store, which also led to increased sales, higher margins, and 
improved labor efficiency, demonstrating significant financial and 
environmental benefits. 
Paper 10: Summary of Prevailing Themes 
A synthesis of the broader literature reveals a strong consensus on several key 
themes. First, the adoption of AI is no longer a matter of choice but a 
competitive necessity for retailers grappling with intense margin pressure and 
evolving consumer expectations (McKinsey). Second, the field is characterized 
by a wide variety of sophisticated modeling techniques, from gradient-boosted 
trees for demand forecasting (Loh et al., 2022) to neural networks and ensemble 
methods that outperform traditional statistical approaches (Haque et al., 2023). 
Finally, there is a rapidly emerging and crucial focus on the non-technical 
aspects of AI deployment. Industry reports and academic papers alike 
emphasize the need for robust data governance, clear ethical guardrails, and a 
focus on building consumer trust to ensure the long-term success and 
sustainability of AI in retail (BRG; Capgemini; EA Journals). 
Chapter 4 : Application areas in recent Days 
Building on the theoretical frameworks, this chapter provides empirical 
evidence for AI as the new retail operating system, examining real-world 
applications that directly address the margin and experiential pressures outlined 
previously. These examples demonstrate AI's tangible impact on both the 
efficiency of core business operations and the quality of customer engagement. 
From optimizing complex supply chains to creating deeply personalized 
shopping journeys, AI is proving to be a versatile and powerful tool for 
addressing the industry's most pressing challenges. 
4.1 Optimizing Core Retail Operations and Supply Chain 
AI is delivering significant value by enhancing the precision and efficiency of 
foundational retail processes. 
• Demand Forecasting and Waste Reduction: AI-powered demand 
forecasting systems are proving highly effective at optimizing inventory and 
reducing waste. For example, German grocery chain REWE leveraged AI to cut 
the number of unavailable items in half, improving customer satisfaction and 
sales. In the realm of sustainability, a study by the Pacific Coast Collaborative 
found that AI solutions from providers like Afresh and Shelf Engine reduced 
food waste in grocery retail by an average of 14.8% by improving the accuracy 
of fresh food ordering. 
• Inventory and Process Automation: Retailers are deploying AI and robotics 
to automate repetitive and labor-intensive tasks in both stores and backrooms. 
Major retailers like Target and Walmart have invested in autonomous cleaning 
robots to free up employee time for customer-facing activities. Walmart has also 
implemented the FAST Unloader technology to automate the process of 
unloading trucks. At Sam's Club, an AI-enhanced version of its Scan & Go 
application validates purchases, reinventing the traditional checkout process for 
hundreds of stores. 
• Markdown Optimization: As detailed in the academic literature, machine 
learning is being used to dynamically manage pricing for promotional events. 
The Promotheus framework developed at ASOS uses AI to determine optimal 
discount levels for clearance items, demonstrating a significant improvement in 
profitability compared to manual pricing strategies. 
4.2 Revolutionizing the Customer Experience 
AI is a key enabler of the frictionless, relevant, and personalized experiences 
that modern consumers expect. 
• Hyper-Personalization: Leading retailers are using AI to analyze customer 
data and deliver tailored experiences. Sephora, for instance, implemented AI
driven personalization tools that utilize detailed beauty profiles and customer 
behavior analytics. This initiative resulted in a 25% increase in average order 
values and a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction. 
• The Rise of "Searchless Retail": The way consumers discover products is 
shifting fundamentally. As detailed by Capgemini, the industry is moving from 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), 
where AI algorithms proactively suggest products. This trend is exemplified by 
Walmart's partnership with OpenAI, which will enable customers to shop 
directly through conversational AI like ChatGPT, anticipating consumer intent 
before a search query is even typed. 
• Emerging Customer-Facing Technologies: A variety of other AI-powered 
tools are enhancing the shopping journey. These include: 
◦ AI-powered customer chatbots and shopping assistants that provide 24/7 
support. 
◦ Virtual clothing try-ons that allow customers to see how garments will fit 
without entering a dressing room. 
◦ Frictionless, checkout-free stores, pioneered by concepts like Amazon Go, 
which use computer vision to eliminate checkout lines. 
◦ Sophisticated recommendation engines, such as Psykhe AI, that go beyond 
purchase history to incorporate personality assessments for more nuanced 
suggestions. 
4.3 Enhancing Marketing, Merchandising, and Pricing 
AI is empowering retailers to make smarter, data-driven decisions in core 
commercial functions. 
• Generative AI in Content Creation: Generative AI models are being used to 
streamline the creation of marketing and product content. Levi Strauss, for 
example, uses this technology to produce first drafts of product descriptions, 
accelerating a time-consuming process and allowing teams to focus on 
refinement. 
• Dynamic Pricing and Promotions: AI enables retailers to adjust prices and 
promotions in real time based on demand, inventory levels, and competitor 
activity. Kroger Edge technology utilizes digital shelves that can dynamically 
display updated prices, personalized coupons, and video advertisements, 
creating a more responsive and engaging in-store environment. 
• Current AI Implementation Trends: A survey of North American retailers 
by Berkeley Research Group reveals where AI is most actively being 
implemented today. Marketing leads the way, followed closely by IT, e
commerce, and merchandising, highlighting a clear focus on customer-facing 
and digital functions.

The breadth of these applications underscores AI's pervasive impact across the 
entire retail ecosystem. Having established the tangible benefits being realized 
today, the final chapter will synthesize the report's conclusions and look ahead 
to the future trajectory and strategic challenges of AI in retail. 
Chapter 5:  Conclusion and The Future Work 
This report has traversed the landscape of Artificial Intelligence in retail, from 
the theoretical foundations laid in academic research to the tangible applications 
delivering value today. This concluding chapter will synthesize the report's key 
findings to form a definitive conclusion on AI's current role and strategic 
importance. It will then project forward, outlining the future trajectory of retail 
intelligence and identifying the critical imperatives that industry leaders must 
address to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that lie 
ahead. 
5.1 Conclusion: AI as a Foundational Requirement 
The primary conclusion of this report is unequivocal: AI is no longer a 
discretionary investment or a competitive choice for retailers, but a foundational 
requirement for survival and success. As argued by McKinsey, the intense and 
unabating pressure on margins, combined with escalating customer 
expectations, has made the adoption of automation and intelligent systems a 
necessity. Retailers who fail to integrate AI into their core strategy risk being 
outmaneuvered by more agile, data-driven competitors. 
The benefits of successful AI adoption, identified throughout this analysis, are 
substantial and multifaceted. The most desired outcome, cited by 54% of 
retailers, is increased operational agility, enabling businesses to respond more 
rapidly to market shifts. This is closely followed by direct financial gains 
through cost reduction, enhanced customer experiences that build loyalty and 
drive revenue, and ultimately, increased profitability. From reducing food waste 
in grocery to optimizing markdown pricing in fashion, AI has proven its ability 
to deliver a measurable return on investment. 
However, the path to meaningful AI adoption is fraught with significant 
challenges that must be overcome. The most significant barriers identified in 
this report are: 
• Internal Bottlenecks: Many retailers are hindered by their own organizational 
inertia. As McKinsey notes, the "soft tyranny of budget cycles" and resistance to 
change can stall even the most promising technology roadmaps. 
• Data Governance: The efficacy of any AI system is contingent on the quality 
of the data it consumes. Yet, a BRG survey found that only 12% of data 
analytics professionals believe their organization's data is of sufficient quality 
for effective AI implementation. Establishing robust frameworks for clean, 
accurate, and compliant data is a critical prerequisite. 
• Consumer Trust and Ethics: The increasing use of personal data to power AI 
systems has given rise to significant consumer concern, with 71% of shoppers 
worried about a lack of clarity in how their data is used. Building trust through 
transparency, ensuring algorithmic fairness, and maintaining human oversight 
are essential for long-term consumer acceptance. 
• Operational Readiness: Promising technologies often falter when they 
encounter the complexities of legacy systems and real-world operational 
constraints. This "last mile problem" requires that AI initiatives be embedded 
within a clearly defined operating model, not simply layered on top of existing 
processes. 
5.2 Future Work: The Next Wave of Retail Intelligence 
Looking forward, the evolution of AI in retail is set to accelerate, moving 
beyond discrete applications toward a more integrated and intelligent 
ecosystem. The next wave will be characterized by what Capgemini describes 
as "ambient AI," where intelligence quietly surrounds the consumer, 
anticipating needs before they are even expressed. This will manifest in hyper
personalized interfaces and autonomous digital companions that create truly 
frictionless and intuitive shopping experiences. 
This technological evolution necessitates a corresponding transformation of the 
workforce. As AI automates manual and repetitive tasks, the demand for 
physical and manual skills will decline. In their place, the need for distinctly 
human capabilities—technological literacy, social acumen, and emotional 
intelligence—will rise sharply. This skills gap presents both a challenge and an 
opportunity. Strategically, reskilling the current workforce is not just a social 
good but a sound business decision. Analysis from McKinsey shows that the 
ROI for reskilling can be 1.5 to 3 times better than hiring new employees, as it 
retains valuable institutional knowledge and mitigates the risks of employee 
resistance to change. 
In conclusion, the retailers who will lead in 2026 and beyond will be those who 
master a dual transformation. They must not only adopt advanced AI 
technologies but also fundamentally reshape their organizations around them. 
Success will be defined by the ability to embed AI within a clear and efficient 
operating model, to build and maintain consumer trust through unwavering 
ethical standards, and to strategically reinvest in their workforce. By 
transforming their people, processes, and platforms in concert, retailers can turn 
the shifting technological landscape from a disruptive threat into a source of 
lasting competitive advantage.
